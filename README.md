Notes : I like how his reserve a room section looks when it is on a smaller screen. I also like his input bars, and wish I would've made them the same way. I did notice a few things that don't match or line up, but overall, on my screen, everything looks great. I also like how his code is commented into sections, very organized. I also like how he used multiple different ways to adjust for responsiveness.
